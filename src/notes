Hello All,

I have created a github repository for Java Group Project.
you can follow below instruction and let me know if you face any issue.

1.open terminal
2.navigate to the folder where we keep all our java projects.
 Example : I keep all my java files here
      cd IdeaProjects
3. Run this in terminal "git clone https://github.com/deepalibhujbal26/JavaGroup12Project1.git"
4. Open JavaGroup12Project1 in intellij
5. Open Example1.java
6. Add System.out.println("hello yourname"); and Run the program.
7. Run this in terminal "git add Example1.java"
8. Run this in terminal "git commit -m " My first java program Example1"
9. Run this in terminal "git push"

Note: this will get us started with github Shared Project and once we all confirm then
we can divide one program each and push to git hub Repo
